# User-Engagement-Analysis

In this case study, we will attempt to drill in and see whether we can explain the source of drop in user engagement. 
Overall we have not found a clear cause for the dip. We have been able to replicate the finding of the analysts, that a dip in engagement has occured, and we found that it is not explained by:

1) A drop in the rate of new users.
2) A drop in users of any one company from the service.
3) A drop in users from a specific country.

The notebook is organized as follows:
1) Problem statement and hypotheses.
2) Data loading, cleaning.
3) Ruling out the first hypothesis related to new users.
4) Ruling out some subsets of the second hypothesis.
